Here we run through a complete "pipeline" of analysis that begins with a single sequence identifier and ends in a PCA analysis. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

## Step 1: Get a Sequence
Receive a sequence for the protein we are interested in. We will take ADK (adenosine kinase) "1ake_A"

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)

aa
```
## Step 2: BLAST Search

Run a BLAST search of the PDB for all related sequences to our input`aa`

```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```
## Step 3: Download structures 
These are our "top hits" i.e. all the structures in the PDB database related to our input. 
```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

## Step 4: Align and Supoerpose 
```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
pdbs
```

## Step 5: PCA

Let's use our old friend PCA to make sense of these confusing, complicated structure relationships. 

```{r}
pc <- pca(pdbs)

plot(pc)
```

Let's make a trajectory (or movie) of the main of the main conformational changes captured by PC1. We will use the `mktrj()` function for this...

```{r}
mktrj(pc, file="pca_result.pdb")
```

Back of the envelope comparison of the PDB size to UniProt

```{r}
uniprot <- 253206171
pdb <- 231029
  
pdb/uniprot * 100
```
